# Overview
Our purpose was to assist Dana, a Data Journalist, with creating a website to compile UFO sighting data and make it publically accessible for **World UFO Day**. 

Initially, we created a table from the raw data using JavaScript, then added filters to create a dynamic user interface, which we then put in an HTML file with Dana's article. The webpage was customized using Bootstrap.

## Results
The webpage has a very simplistic design and features the compiled UFO sighting data in table format. It gives the user the option to filter by Date of sighting, observed Shape of sighting, as well as City, State, or County where sighting occurred. 

The filter options are shown with placeholders so the user can see instantly what type of input belongs in each container.

The table itself displays sightings in chronological order by default, and includes additional information such as duration of sighting, as well as descriptive comments about the event.

To filter the data, simply enter the desired search criteria. For example: to find all sightings of a triangular shape from the database, type "triangle" in the **Enter Shape** box.

Note: All data is lowercase and the filters are case sensitive. In addition, the data format of MM/DD/YYYY must be followed to yield results. 


## Summary
The main drawback to our current wepage design is the specificity of the filters. For example, users may find the lowercase requirement for the state filter to be unnatural, as state abbreviations are most normally capitalized. 

In the future, giving users the ability to select each sighting via hyperlink and open a new page which features photos, written accounts and other relevant information about the sighting would add depth to the user experience. 
In addition, links to articles, research, and the aforementioned sighting hyperlinks, will require improved navigation of the interface. A main menu being the most necessary addition for seamless navigation.
